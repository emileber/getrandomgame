# What is it? #

First, its a game. An RPG. More Rogue-like, but not as difficult because of: Permadeth? Probably, but optional!

You're in a world, a fantastic universe, where you're what you want to be. You can be, let's see:
  * An adventurer (you guess!)
    * Warrior, mage or whatever specialty you want or even both!
    * Rogue, archer, priest, barbarian, you can too, in fact, you are all of them.
  * A miner
  * A lumberjack
  * A carpenter (why not)
  * A shop owner
  * A merchant
  * An enchanter
  * An assassin
  * A warlord
  * A vampire (you first must encounter a vampire)
  * Or all of the above!

But you CAN'T be:
  * The chosen one
  * A God
  * The best in everything
  * A god-like person
  * The king of the world
  * A boat captain
Except if you become one as you play. You need to earn those before claiming you are.

Every game is different because the world is randomly generated each game you play. You always play in the same world if you want, but in the other hand, you can regenerate a new world every time you want.

We are students of the "Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (UQAC)".

It combines lot of text strings in multiple files that we call a programming language and the one we use is C++ (C plus plus).

It's developed in the Eclipse CDT IDE

The project is divide in multiple parts that are:
  * A Tile Engine
    * Using SDL encapsulated in an interface class to ease its use
    * Sprites/animations handles
    * Timer
    * Token and general stuff
